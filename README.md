# CasaVidaOS Landing Page

This repository contains a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) site for the Casa-VidaOS landing page. It is configured so the static output can be hosted on GitHub Pages for testing or demonstration.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Static Export

To build the site and generate a static export (useful for GitHub Pages):

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The exported files will be placed in the `out` folder.
